:heart:  Backend is powered by [aws-lambda-powertools-java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-java) and [aws-lambda-powertools-python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-python)

Use AWS Serverless stack to build a full fledged web application with both
backend and frontend hosted inside a same mono repo.

Backend CI/CD pipeline and backend infrastructure is written using SAM.
Frontend CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure is written using CDK Java.

Application builds a React static web app, which talks to bunch of APIs hosted via API gateway and talking to 
lambda functions, S3 and dynamoDB as backends. Feature of web application itself is simple. Since that is not the main 
purpose here.  User can basically upload an image with a metadata. Then if user want, they can try uploading 
another image from another flow, and try to find face in it. If its found in Dynamo DB, then
we return the metadata. 

## Architecture diagram for the application

## Pre requisite

Make sure you have [aws cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli#getting-started) installed and configured with an aws account you want to use.


## Creating backend with Full CI/CD pipeline

_Note:_ If you wish to provision backend without CI/CD, refer instructions [here](#creating-backend-without-full-cicd-pipelinemanually) 

Assuming your region is `eu-west-1`, run below commands. Replace region value with your workload region.

- Create backend CI/CD pipelines for deploying backend resource via cloudformation.  You can either choose 
to deploy backend in python or in java. Both are deployed via SAM.

###### Java Backend

:heart:  Backend is powered by [aws-lambda-powertools-java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-java)

```
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name serverless-web-application-java-backend-pipeline --template-body file://java-app-backend/serverless-pipeline.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND CAPABILITY_IAM --region eu-west-1
```

- Trigger Code build for deploying java backend resources via pipeline. It will use SAM to deploy serverless backend stack.

```
    aws codebuild start-build --project-name WebAppJavaBackendPipelineDetector --region eu-west-1
``` 

###### Python Backend

:heart:  Backend is powered by [aws-lambda-powertools-python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-python)

```
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name serverless-web-application-python-backend-pipeline --template-body file://python-app-backend/serverless-pipeline.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND CAPABILITY_IAM --region eu-west-1
```

- Trigger Code build for deploying python backend resources via pipeline. It will use SAM to deploy serverless backend stack.

```
    aws codebuild start-build --project-name WebAppPythonBackendPipelineDetector --region eu-west-1
``` 

- After this step, codepipeline should take care of deploying your backend resources. If you choose to deploy with manual approval step, Navigate to [pipeline](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines/WebApplicationBackendPipeline/view?region=eu-west-1) 
and approve to deploy the stack.

## Creating frontend with full CI/CD pipeline (Supports CDK Pipelines construct)

**Note**: This Project now also provides supports for building CICD pipeline using [CDK pipeline construct](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/announcing-cdk-pipelines-ga-ci-cd-cdk-apps/).
You may choose to either use CDK pipeline construct or setup using native L2 codepipeline constructs directly. Steps for both the ways are mentioned below. 

_Note:_ If you wish to provision frontend without CI/CD, refer instructions [here](#creating-backend-without-full-cicd-pipelinemanually)

Assuming your region is `eu-west-1`, run below commands. Replace region value with your workload region.

- Update backend endpoints in [GlobalConstants](frontend/src/GlobalConstants.ts). Backend endpoints can be found 
by navigating to [API gateway console](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?region=eu-west-1)

- Revisit [cdk.json](frontend-infrastructure/cdk.json) for configurtion of frontend stack. 
You might want to update `approval_emails`, `cert_domain`. If you don't want to host on a custom domain, 
leave `cert_domain` as empty string. Leaving `approval_emails` as empty won't create any approval stage.

- ### Create frontend CI/CD pipelines for deploying frontend resource via cdk using [CDK pipeline construct](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/announcing-cdk-pipelines-ga-ci-cd-cdk-apps/).

```
    cd frontend-infrastructure/
```
```  
    mvn clean install
```
```
    cdk synth serverless-web-application-frontend-cdk-pipeline --region eu-west-1
```
```
    cdk bootstrap --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
```
```
    cdk deploy serverless-web-application-frontend-cdk-pipeline --region eu-west-1 --require-approval never
```

- Trigger Code build for deploying resources via pipeline.

```
    aws codebuild start-build --project-name WebApplicationFrontEndCdkPipelineDetector --region eu-west-1
``` 

- ### Create frontend CI/CD pipelines for deploying frontend resource via cdk. 

**Note:** Perform below steps only if you have not set up the pipeline already using [CDK pipeline construct](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/announcing-cdk-pipelines-ga-ci-cd-cdk-apps/).

```
    cd frontend-infrastructure/
```
```  
    mvn clean install
```
```
    cdk synth serverless-web-application-frontend-pipeline --region eu-west-1
```
```
    cdk bootstrap
```
```
    cdk deploy serverless-web-application-frontend-pipeline --region eu-west-1 --require-approval never
```

- Trigger Code build for deploying resources via pipeline.

```
    aws codebuild start-build --project-name WebApplicationFrontEndPipelineDetector --region eu-west-1
``` 

- If you are using custom domain, make sure to register created named servers on Route53 hosted zone with your domain 
provider.  

- 1st deployment of frontend will take some time since its need to initialise cloudfront distribution etc.

- After this step, codepipeline should take care of deploying your frontend resources. If you choose to deploy with manual approval step, Navigate to [pipeline](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines/WebApplicationBackendPipeline/view?region=eu-west-1) 
and approve to deploy the stack.


## Creating backend without Full CI/CD pipeline(Manually)

###### Java Backend

```
  cd java-app-backend/
```
```
  sam build
```
- Run below command and pick default options. 
```
  sam deploy --guided --stack-name serverless-web-application-java-backend --capabilities CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND CAPABILITY_IAM
```

###### Python Backend

```
  cd python-app-backend/
```
```
  sam build
```

- Run below command and pick default options. 
```
  sam deploy --guided --stack-name serverless-web-application-python-backend --capabilities CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND CAPABILITY_IAM
```

## Creating frontend without Full CI/CD pipeline(Manually)

- After one of the backend is created successfully, update backend endpoints in [GlobalConstants](frontend/src/GlobalConstants.ts). 
Backend endpoints can be found by navigating to [API gateway console](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?region=eu-west-1)

- Revisit [cdk.json](frontend-infrastructure/cdk.json) for configurtion of frontend stack. `cert_domain`. 
If you don't want to host on a custom domain, leave `cert_domain` as empty string. 

- Build frontend code
```
  cd frontend/
```
```
  npm install
 
  npm run build
```

- Build frontend infrastructure
```
  cd ../frontend-infrastructure/
```
```
  mvn clean install
```
```
  cdk synthesize serverless-web-application-frontend
```
```
  cdk deploy serverless-web-application-frontend
```

- If you are using custom domain, make sure to register created named servers on Route53 hosted zone with your domain 
provider.
